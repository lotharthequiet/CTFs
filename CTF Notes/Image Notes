General Image Notes
-------------------

1. Check the EXIF data.

2. See if anything is encrypted in the COMMENTS section or any other data appears to be encrypted or hashed.

3. Check to see if there are any errors displayed in the EXIF data. This can potentially lead to hidden data.

4. Use BINWALK (binwalk -e filename.ext) to check to see if binary data is hidden in image file.

5. Check for hidden info in the image while viewing the image in an image editor.

6. Try bruteforce stegonography tools.
